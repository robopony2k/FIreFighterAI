TSK-0149: Cap strategic fast time and keep 3D visual sync current

Type: bug

Why: Strategic fast-time controls exposed 40x/80x debug speeds that could let simulation advance through seasonal work faster than 3D terrain and structure visuals could stay current, making bottlenecks look like later catch-up pauses.

Done when:
- [x] Strategic preset buttons, slider sanitization, and Advance to Next Event cap at 20x.
- [x] Runtime frame budgeting preserves requested speed telemetry but clamps effective strategic simulation speed to 20x before lower simulation caps.
- [x] Fast time no longer defers terrain sync purely because speed is high, and simulation yields while 3D terrain visual sync is pending.
- [x] Regression coverage asserts the 20x cap and updates runtime perf coverage to supported high-speed values.

Touchpoints: `src/core/timeSpeed.ts`, `src/core/config.ts`, `src/app/bootLoop.ts`, `src/app/gameSessionRuntime.ts`, `src/systems/terrain/controllers/`, `scripts/time-speed-regression.mjs`, `scripts/runtime-perf-regression.mjs`

Constraints: keep incident-time pacing unchanged, preserve runtime perf telemetry, and keep terrain sync policy owned by the terrain controller boundary.

Status: done

TSK-0148: Spring growth terrain rebuild and settlement road replay fix

Type: bug

Why: High-speed winter-to-spring growth could replay town expansion work in the same frame as terrain visual refresh, causing road-only or structure-only settlement growth to force multi-second base terrain rebuilds.

Done when:
- [x] Generated settlement growth road segments record replayable paths and bridge tile indices.
- [x] Runtime planned expansion prefers recorded path replay and exposes runtime road-search fallback telemetry.
- [x] Terrain visual sync separates road-layer refreshes from base terrain geometry rebuilds, with perf telemetry for rebuild reason and road refresh timing.
- [x] Growth regression coverage asserts recorded road paths avoid runtime path search and legacy plans still fall back safely.

Touchpoints: `src/systems/settlements/`, `src/mapgen/roads.ts`, `src/sim/index.ts`, `src/render/threeTest.ts`, `src/render/threeTestTerrain.ts`, `src/systems/terrain/controllers/`, `scripts/growth-regression.mjs`

Constraints: keep road replay behind the settlement road adapter, preserve legacy synthetic/no-plan world fallback, and avoid broad terrain renderer decomposition beyond the road-layer refresh path.

Notes: Follow-up renderer decomposition remains tracked by `TSK-0134`.

Status: done

TSK-0138: Runtime spike budget and fire-season terrain sync refactor

Type: refactor

Why: High-speed strategic fire seasons could put fire catch-up, terrain visual sync, and 3D snapshot work into the same frame, producing significant lag spikes and making optimization hard to attribute.

Done when:
- [x] Fire runtime work exposes substep, deferred-day, terrain-mutation, ranged-diffusion, and ignition-candidate telemetry.
- [x] High-speed fire work is bounded per frame and carries deferred fire simulation work instead of processing every catch-up substep immediately.
- [x] Terrain visual sync policy is owned by a terrain controller and separates geometry, surface-color, vegetation, structure, and fire-visual invalidation.
- [x] Runtime perf regression coverage exists for high-speed fire scenarios.

Touchpoints: `src/app/bootLoop.ts`, `src/app/gameSessionRuntime.ts`, `src/sim/index.ts`, `src/systems/fire/`, `src/systems/terrain/controllers/`, `scripts/runtime-perf-regression.mjs`

Constraints: preserve incident readability, keep fire simulation independent from rendering/UI, and allow only small behavior shifts from bounded high-speed catch-up.

Notes: This precedes `TSK-0134`; terrain renderer decomposition should build on the new terrain visual sync boundary.

Status: done

TSK-0137: Add dust construction effect for house build phases

Type: polish

Why: House lifecycle stages already change geometry, but `site_prep`, `frame`, and `enclosed` builds still read as visually static during town growth. A lightweight dust effect would make active construction easier to spot and sell settlement growth better.

Done when:
- [ ] `site_prep`, `frame`, and `enclosed` house lifecycle stages can drive a lightweight construction-dust effect in the 3D runtime, while `roofed` and `charred_remains` stay unaffected.
- [ ] Dust timing/intensity is derived from lifecycle stage or visual-step progress so early construction reads differently from late construction instead of acting like constant ambient smoke.
- [ ] The house lifecycle FX Lab preview or an equivalent debugable surface can show the dust effect so it can be tuned without waiting on a live town-growth repro.

Touchpoints: `src/systems/settlements/sim/buildingLifecycle.ts`, `src/systems/settlements/rendering/`, `src/render/simView.ts`, `src/render/threeTest.ts`, `src/render/fxLab/`

Constraints: preserve current house lifecycle silhouettes and determinism, keep the effect visually distinct from fire smoke, and avoid meaningfully increasing the steady-state FX budget for towns with many simultaneous builds.

Notes: Prefer settlement-owned construction FX descriptors/data over burying lifecycle-specific rules directly inside generic fire-FX code.

Status: queued

TSK-0133: Type and isolate the fire simulation kernel

Type: refactor

Why: The core fire step is still under `@ts-nocheck` and mixes fire math with FX, destruction, and scoring side effects.

Done when:
- [x] `src/sim/fire.ts` no longer uses `@ts-nocheck`.
- [x] The numeric fire update path is separated from smoke/destruction/scoring side effects.
- [x] Fixed-seed fire regression results match current behavior.

Touchpoints: `src/sim/fire.ts`, `src/sim/fire/*`, fire regression scripts

Constraints: preserve spread behavior, block processing, and scheduled ignition semantics

Notes: Move or remove the dormant baseline branch only after typed parity is established.

Status: done

TSK-0134: Decompose terrain renderer and remove the debug cycle

Type: refactor

Why: `src/render/threeTestTerrain.ts` is a render monolith and currently participates in a cycle with terrain debug provenance code.

Done when:
- [ ] `TerrainRenderSurface` lives in a neutral terrain-render module.
- [ ] The debug provenance module no longer imports from `threeTestTerrain.ts`.
- [ ] Water, vegetation/structures, and surface-prep responsibilities are split into focused render modules.

Touchpoints: `src/render/threeTestTerrain.ts`, `src/render/terrain/debug/`, `src/render/terrain/water/`, `src/render/terrain/`

Constraints: preserve visual output and large-map performance characteristics

Notes: Keep `prepareTerrainRenderSurface` and `buildTerrainMesh` as stable facade exports during the split.

Related: `TSK-0138` moved terrain visual sync policy out of app runtime; continue using that boundary when splitting renderer modules.

Status: queued
